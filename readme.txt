What we have completed: We have support for int, pointers, and strings.

What remains incomple: We have not figured out how to get nstdlib to work correctly, so we put a nstdlib.h file and nstdlib.c file in our tests file. We did not set a scope for variables.

Extensions: We have a type checking system and we also create a symbol table.

TODO:
  fix ternary (don't know what to do yet))
  fix scope (delete items from symbol_table when they aren't in scope)
  nstdlib (don't know what to do yet)
