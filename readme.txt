got the test2.n working better.
started work on test1.n and made expr_add_node.
If you get on before me could you try to figure out why
the wrong evaluate is getting called. Its calling evaluate
from expr_node instead of int_literal_node and I can't figure out why.
Other than that making good progress on test1.n


files not staged on git:
  StrUtil.h - not relevant to our assignment, will be deleted eventually
  makefile  - hopefully no changes will be required, so not needed in repo
  yy.cc/.h  - just defines some error handling for us, maybe not added to?
