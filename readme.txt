What we have completed: We have support for int, pointers, and strings.

What remains incomplete: We have not figured out how to get nstdlib to work correctly, we did write an nstdlib, but have been having a lot of problems getting it to be included correctly. The example program is not running correctly, it segfaults. We have a lot of other tests that work fine.

Extensions: We have a type checking system and we also create a symbol table.
