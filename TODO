-fix nstrlen. I think this entails fixing our definition of what a
  naught string is. we should probably be mallocing space for an int
  and the c-string,and then somehow returning a pointer to the string
  part.

-clean up code. This involves removing unneessary includes, and (most
  importantly) adding a bunch of comments.

-if we want to add more of our test naught files to the makefile that
  might be good. I just added the basics and important ones.
